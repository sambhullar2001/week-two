# Introduction 
This week was the most interesting week yet in CLCV 3000... finally we get to do the fun stuff!

From the readings it is evident that this week's main priority, other than going out and collecting information, is collecting information ***ethically***. Ethics has a rough history with archaeology. Originally a "gentleman's hobby" in which rich colonists would take artifacts and other interesting memorials without any regard to it's history or the site itself.... the field has come a long way; and yet still... has a long way ***to go.*** Now that digital archaeology is emerging from a small-niche field into the mainstream, it comes at no surprise that the discourse of ethics is brought up once more.

## Interesting Quotes from the Readings

"*Although the growing popularity of current digital platforms which share information about cemeteries andburial sites (e.g. ancestry.com and findagrave.com) demonstrates a ready audience, unsystematic data collection and issues with ethics, access, and cost may limit their usefulness and flexibility.*" (Cook, Katherine. 2018 Open Data as Public Archaeology: The Monumental Archive Project. AP: Online Journal of Public Archaeology 3: 177-194)
- This is possibly the most interesting aspect to doing mortuary archaeology through a digital medium for me. There are SO MANY geneaology websites on the internet, with thousands of profiles and tons of information of deceased persons. Information that is personal... who is to say one would not use such information in a harmful manner? The ethics of such sites tread on a very thin line, and as a researcher for this course, it would be a line that one would have to be cautious not to cross.


"*Outside scholarly communities (and within it), generational, cultural, and socio-economic barriers to digital literacy are a significant challenge for encouraging data reuse.*" (Lacy, Robyn S. 2018. Public Engagement through Burial Landscapes: Cupids and Ferryland, Newfoundland. AP: Online Journal of Public Archaeology, Special Volume 3: Death in the Contemporary World: Perspectives from Public Archaeology. Pp. 55-78)
- This is a really interesting point, and one that I believe ties into the ethics portion of this week's readings. Because, truly, how ethical can we be if we are not *inclusive* with our research. It cannot be understated how important the input, opinions, and experiences of different cultures and peoples is in order to paint a whole and complete picture as archaeologists. Furthermore, by truly understanding the opinions and traditions of different groups we lessen the chance of inappropriately utilizing the knowledge of different cultures and traditions.


***In terms of the current research...*** it is imperative that we follow the ethical frameworks laid out in order to make sure the research is being done in a respectful manner.
- when I had chosen Beechwood in order to conduct my research, I had e-mailed Nicholas McCarthy (Director of Marketing @ Beechwood), whom had given me the all-clear. However, I still had to tread on a respectful line. I was cautious enough to ask inside if there were any memorial services/off-limits areas. The reception was kind enough to provide me with the necessary details, and allowed for me to take photography of the graves; Nicholas had even me to send in the pictures, thought that request left me a bit confused, ***just because*** the photos themselves were not professionally done... however, I happily obliged either way.

However, even after being given the all-clear by Beechwood higher-ups, a much more ***emotional*** kind of ethical line presents itself. Death, in it of itself, is a scary thing to think about. There is a reason why humans attempt to rationalise it through faith and spirituality... because the unknown is frightening. Conversely, death is more than an end of a life... it's the end of a relationship. As a result, there a often times very deep, deep emotions associated with death - and I'd argue such emotions blur the line of ethics in mortuary archaeology. One of the reasons, I believe, ethics in archaeology are much more clear-cut compared to other fields (such as medicine)... is because for the most of the time, the people whose things we examine, and live's we peek into.... are dead. They are gone, and have been for hundreds, if not *thousands*, of years. There was no true ethical line that had to be followed when archaeologists examined Otzi the Ice Man.... but examining the grave of someone who had recently passed... that is ***different***. Such a deceased person may still have family and friends living and still deeply hurt about their passing. Ethics blurs here a bit, and the normal frameworks no longer apply in the same ways.
- during my time examining graves, I felt very self-conscious of my work whenever I'd see an individual or group pass by. Though the specific plot I had chosen (plot 64) was the oldest on the entire vicinity... I still felt as if I was *intruding* on something. The deceased of whose graves I researched/measured where not some distant ancients, they were modern people. Most of whom had just passed away a few decades ago, most of whose families were still alive - the image of their memory still fresh in their minds. Would they really want the memory of their loved one to be that of a University student's project? As a result, I would feel at fault for something; always freezing out of guilt (for lack of a better word) when I saw ***anyone*** pass by. To be fair, as a researcher that is perhaps the worst thing to do. If your intentions are pure... then you should act as it; yet, the instrinsic guilt would come out.

**To Conclude**
All in all, it was an interesting week! Certainly my first doing research to this extent, and I felt like a real archaeologist going out into the field and conducting measurements and whatnot. Obviously there is still an ethical line that must be followed, and it would be interesting to see how in the coming weeks it shapes together!!

***As for feedback***, I would like to know how personal to make these journal entries. Are pronouns alright (can I refer to myself as 'I'), or should I opt for something much more professional?
