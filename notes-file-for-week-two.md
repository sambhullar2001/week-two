# what I was trying to do
- create a proper sketch of the grave site
- upload measurements/photos to kobotoolbox

**monday:**
- okay! I'm looking at the Wk2 instructions... and get the dreaded feeling that i MAY have done things a bit backwards. I had already gone out and gotten measurements + pictures of different grave sites from Beechwood Cemetery, and so I'll have to log my findings into Kobotoolbox now and sketch my area AFTER... it's alright though, it's all a part of the process
- The folks over at Beechwood were super nice (shoutout to Melissa who gave me numerous maps and historical portraits from the archives!), and welcoming!
- I focused on finding older graves, as a result most of the data i've collected comes from graves dating back to the 19th century. 

**tuesday:**
- okay, so the map sketching is much more difficult than I thought. I know we can use google earth to get a proper satelite view of the site. However when positioning maps over the site I get this....

- Yeah... firstly, i'd like to apologise for the horrible, horrible outline skills. The red outline represents the general area of the site itself, whereas the blue outline presents the presence of a short stone wall (~1/2m in height). As a result, the area is divided into "two portions". 
- Half of my grave sites were found in the "Stone-walled" area, whereas the other half were on the other side. if it is not clear enough, the trees block the view of the sats; as a result, I don't have a proper view. 
-  I did do some rough sketches of the area during my visit there, and will see tomorrow how accurate they are.... if not, i'll have to go back!

**Wednesday/thursday:**
- alrighty! So i've made the sketch... it's REALLY rough, and hence, I'd appreciate any feedback to make it more detailed!!

**Friday/Saturday/Sunday**:
- spent this time recording the measurements onto Kobotoolbox
- No discernable issues were encountered
- 
## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
- not ***much*** researching this time around; this week's work was very much "go-out-in-the-field-and-record-stuff" based

## challenges 
- properly sketching out my map

## thoughts on where to go next
- i'm still pretty early into the semester, however from here the only logical step would be to begin the 3-d photo models of the graves
